# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Created R script called 'run_analysis.R' that does the following:

1.	Download the zip file in the working directory
2.	Extract the zip file in the working directory
3.	Read the Activity Labels and Features files 
4.	Grab the mean and standard deviation only variables as labels
5.	Load the test and train datasets 
6.	Merge train and data sets and labels 
7.	Create columns named as subjects and activity
8.	Turn activity and subjects into factors 
9.	Create tidy dataset that contains the mean value of each subject and activity. 
10.	The result is saved as tidy.txt
